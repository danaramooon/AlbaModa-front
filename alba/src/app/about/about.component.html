              <p class = "text" >Fashion blogs have been around since the early 2000s, but today,
                  blogging is a whole new ball game. While fashion blogs are at an all-time high,
                  we can’t argue against the fact that social media platforms like Instagram remain
                  the single largest forum to redirect traffic towards fashion blogs. But we are not complaining,
                  because that’s made our lives twice as easy. It’s a hashtag game out there, and that’s how
                  we are neck deep into people’s profiles – engrossed, enamored, and even losing a few days while
                  browsing one hashtag after another. Sometimes it can be overwhelming too, to see every second
                  influencer with thousands of followers (and sometimes millions) and the stuff they have to offer.
                  But some fashion bloggers manage to stand out despite all of it. And we are going to talk about them today.
                  If fashion and being updated is your thing, you need to follow them! Check the list, below!</p>
